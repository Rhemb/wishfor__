# Wishfor__

<a href="https://github.com/Rhemb/wishfor__" alt="wishfor-repo" target="_blank">Wishfor__ </a> is an app created to make building a wishlist for any occasion easy! 

- Whether its a christmas list or just a regular list for everyday things, this allows you to add links from any website of your choice and have it stored all in one place.
- It can become unorganized when having to build a list when some items can only be saved in one place or require you to save a bookmark on it in your browser.
- Building this app allowed me to learn more about the process of login/registration with validations as well as implementing protected routing.
